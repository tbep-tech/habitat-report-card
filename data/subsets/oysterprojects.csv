Each oyster shell bag was filled with fossilized shells and laid perpendicular to the shoreline in various arrangements based on substrate stability and shoreline slope. The shell bags were transported (by boat), unloaded, and placed at 2D Island by Tampa Bay Watch staff and volunteers .","Estuarine Shoreline","Shoreline Stabilization/Enhancement","Erosion Control
